Frank Baum's beloved wizard character. When Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a small-time circus magician with dubious ethics, is hurled away from dusty Kansas to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he's hit the jackpot-fame and fortune are his for the taking-that is until he meets three witches, Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams), who are not convinced he is the great wizard everyone's been expecting. Reluctantly drawn into the epic problems facing the Land of Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find out who is good and who is evil before it is too late. Putting his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity-and even a bit of wizardry-Oscar transforms himself not only into the great wizard but into a better man as well. When small-time magician Oscar Diggs (James Franco) pulls one flimflam too many, he finds himself hurled into the fantastical Land of Oz where he must somehow transform himself into the great wizard-and just maybe into a better man as well. -- (C) Walt Disney","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_mob.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_pro.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_det.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/82/11168213_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"James Franco","id":"162653202","characters":["Oz","The Wizard"]},{"name":"Mila Kunis","id":"364629418","characters":["Theodora/Wicked Witch of the West","Theodorah"]},{"name":"Rachel Weisz","id":"162653682","characters":["Evanora"]},{"name":"Michelle Williams","id":"162653583","characters":["Annie/Glinda"]},{"name":"Zach Braff","id":"162655018","characters":["Frank/Finley","Oz's Assistant"]}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1623205"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175.json","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oz_the_great_and_powerful/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/cast.json","clips":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/clips.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211175/similar.json"}},{"id":"771189410","title":"Jack the Giant Slayer","year":2013,"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":114,"critics_consensus":"It's enthusiastically acted and reasonably fun, but Jack the Giant Slayer is also overwhelmed by digital effects and a bland, impersonal story.","release_dates":{"theater":"2013-03-01"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Rotten","critics_score":51,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":62},"synopsis":"\"Jack the Giant Slayer\" tells the story of an ancient war that is reignited when a young farmhand unwittingly opens a gateway between our world and a fearsome race of giants.
